# Python Ship Logbook

This is an implementation of a Ship Logbook Service responsible for receiving, collecting, processing and presenting data from "VDR - Vessel Data Recorders" and making it available for further analysis or storage. The primary goal of a Ship Logbook Service is maintaining an precise log of essential ship instruments readings such as vessel position, speed, heading, engine parameters, rudder movements, communications, alarms and many others. The secondary goal is to provide a way to access this data in a convenient way. For such a task the service provides a "Data Ingestor Service" to receive data from the VRD and a "Data Dashboard Service" to provide access to the data though an dashboard. The services also provides a "Data Disgestor Service" to process the data and make it available for further analysis,  storage or disposal through a API so other services can access it.

## Architecture

The Ship Logbook Service is composed of three main components:

- Data Ingestor Service
- Data Dashboard Service
- Data Disgestor Service
