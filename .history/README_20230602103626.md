# Python Ship Logbook

This is an implementation of a Ship Logbook Service responsible for receiving, collecting, processing and presenting data from "VDR - Vessel Data Recorders" and making it available for further analysis, storage and searchability. The primary goal of a Ship Logbook Service is maintaining a precise log of essential ship instruments readings such as vessel position, speed, heading, engine parameters, rudder movements, communications, alarms and many others. The secondary goal is to provide a way to access this data in a convenient way. For such a task the service provides a "Data Ingestor Service" to receive data from the VRD and a "Data Dashboard Service" to provide access to the data though a dashboard. The services also provides a "Data Disgestor Service" to process the data and make it available for further analysis,  storage or disposal through a API so other services can access it.

## 1) Architecture

The Ship Logbook Service is composed of three main components:

- Data Ingestor Service
- Data Dashboard Service
- Data Disgestor Service

**1.1) Data Ingestor Service**

The Data Ingestor Service is responsible for receiving data from the VDRs and storing it in a database. The Ingestor connects to the VDRs through a TCP connection and receives data in the form of NMEA sentences. The Ingestor parses the NMEA sentences and stores the data in a database. As the ship may have issues regarding connectivity, the Ingestor is responsible for keeping trying to connect to the VDRs and each time it connects it will pull all the data that was not received yet. Readings should be saved in a cronomological order, so the Ingestor should be able to detect if readings are out of order, it should be able to detect duplicate entries. Readings should be saved to database in a way that it is easy to query them by time range, by type of reading, by ship, by ship and time range, by ship and type of reading, by ship, type of reading and time range. The Ingestor should be able to detect if the VDR is sending data that is not in the NMEA format and alert developers. 

**1.2) Data Dashboard Service**

The Data Dashboard Service is responsible for providing a user graphic interface to access the data. The dashboard should be able to show the data in a way that is easy to understand and navigate. The dashboard should be compatible with desktop and mobile browsers, it also should have a responsive design. Graphic interface should be easy to understand and should be as clear as possible. The dashboard should permit to choose from all available ships, may they be active or inactive. Active meaning when the VDR - Vessel Data Recorder is turned on, and inactive meaning when the VDR is turned off. The dashboard should inform if any expected reading from VDR is not present and alert developers. 

**1.3) Data Disgestor Service**

The Data Disgestor Service is responsible to post-processing VDR data and make this data searchable through a GraphQL API. Disgestor should allow direct result data from database, but also asking for data in a asyncronous way. For example, the client may query for a specific data and the Disgestor should return a "pending" status and a "request id". The client may then query for the same data using the "request id" and the Disgestor should return the data if it is ready.

## 2) VDR - Vessel Data Recorder

Ships often have dedicated devices known as VDR, which stands for "Voyage Data Recorders" or "Vessel Data Recorders", that collect and store various vessel data readings. These recorders are specifically designed to capture and record critical data related to the vessel's navigation, operation, and safety.

VDRs are similar to "black boxes" used in aircraft and are mandated by international maritime regulations, such as the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) convention. They are typically installed on larger ships, including commercial vessels, passenger ships, and certain types of offshore vessels.

VDRs are equipped with sensors and interfaces to collect data from various onboard systems, including navigation instruments, radar systems, gyrocompasses, GPS receivers, engine and machinery sensors, bridge audio communications, and other relevant equipment. The collected data can include information such as vessel position, speed, heading, engine parameters, rudder movements, communications, and alarms.

In addition to data collection, VDRs often have the capability to record audio and capture images from bridge cameras or other surveillance systems. This comprehensive data recording helps in investigating accidents, understanding vessel operations, analyzing incidents, and improving safety and operational practices.

The recorded data from VDRs is typically stored in a secure and tamper-proof manner, and in the event of an incident, it can be retrieved for analysis and investigation purposes by authorities or ship operators.
However, VDRs can also streamming data in real time to a remote server or allow remote connections to download the data. This is the case of the VDRs used in this project.

**2.1) NMEA - National Marine Electronics Association**

The NMEA 0183 standard defines an electrical interface and data protocol for communications between marine electronic devices such as echo sounder, sonars, anemometer (wind speed and direction), gyrocompass, autopilot, GPS receivers and many other types of instruments. It has been defined by, and is controlled by, the US-based National Marine Electronics Association.

NMEA sentences are standardized data formats used in marine navigation and communication systems. These sentences are ASCII-based and provide a structured way to transmit various types of data between marine electronic devices. NMEA sentences typically start with a dollar sign ($) followed by a two-letter talker ID that identifies the type of device or system providing the data.

Here are a few examples of commonly used NMEA sentences:

Global Positioning System (GPS) Data:

$GPGGA: GPS Fix Data
<code>$GPGGA,123519,4807.038,N,01131.000,E,1,08,0.9,545.4,M,46.9,M,,*47</code>
This sentence provides GPS fix information, including time, latitude, longitude, number of satellites in use, altitude, and more.

$GPRMC: Recommended Minimum Navigation Information
<code>$GPRMC,123519,A,4807.038,N,01131.000,E,022.4,084.4,230394,003.1,W*6A</code>
This sentence provides essential GPS data such as time, date, latitude, longitude, speed, and course.

Depth Data:

$SDDBT: Depth below transducer
<code>$SDDBT,12.3,f,3.7,M,2.0,F*0C</code>
This sentence provides depth information measured by the transducer in both feet and meters.

Wind Data:

$WIMWV: Wind Speed and Angle
<code>$WIMWV,84.3,R,12.4,N,A*0B</code>
This sentence provides wind speed and angle information, including relative (R) or true (T) wind direction.

AIS (Automatic Identification System) Data:

$AIVDM: AIS VHF Data Link Message
Example: $AIVDM,1,1,,A,13aH52P0tP00l4CNOvNk9An00SGt,0*7E
This sentence contains encoded AIS information transmitted by nearby vessels.

Compass Data:

$HCHDG: Heading, Deviation, and Variation
Example: $HCHDG,179.8,,,,*14
This sentence provides heading information from a compass, including deviation and variation.


These examples represent just a few of the many NMEA sentence formats available. Different marine devices and systems support various NMEA sentences to facilitate data exchange and interoperability between equipment on board a vessel.
