# Python Ship Logbook

This is an implementation of a Ship Logbook Service responsible for receiving, collecting, processing and presenting data from "VDR - Vessel Data Recorders" and making it available for further analysis or storage. The primary goal of a Ship Logbook Service is maintaining an precise log of essential ship instruments readings such as vessel position, speed, heading, engine parameters, rudder movements, communications, alarms and many others. The secondary goal is to provide a way to access this data in a convenient way. For such a task the service provides a "Data Ingestor Service" to receive data from the VRD and a "Data Dashboard Service" to provide access to the data though an dashboard. The services also provides a "Data Disgestor Service" to process the data and make it available for further analysis,  storage or disposal through a API so other services can access it.

## Architecture

The Ship Logbook Service is composed of three main components:

- Data Ingestor Service
- Data Dashboard Service
- Data Disgestor Service

1) Data Ingestor Service

The Data Ingestor Service is responsible for receiving data from the VDR and storing it in a database. The Ingestor connects to the VDR through a TCP connection and receives data in the form of NMEA sentences. The Ingestor parses the NMEA sentences and stores the data in a database. As the ship may have issues regarding connectivity, the Ingestor is responsible for keeping trying to connect to the VDR and each time it connects it will pull all the data that was not received yet. Readings should be saved in a cronomological order, so the Ingestor should be able to detect if readings are out of order, it should be able to de
