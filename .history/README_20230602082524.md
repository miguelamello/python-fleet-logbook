# Python Ship Logbook

This is an implementation of a Ship Logbook Service responsible for receiving, collecting, processing and presenting data from a "Vessel Data Recorders" and making it available for further analysis or storage. The primary goal of a Ship Logbook Service is maintaining an precise log of essential ship instruments readings such as GPS positions, ship speed, wind speed, wind direction, sea waves direction and speed, weather forecast, engine status, operational status and many other data. The secondary goal is to provide a way to access this data in a convenient way. For such a task the service provides a "Data Ingestor Service" to receive data from the ship  and a "Data Dashboard Microservice" to provide access to the data though an dashboard. The services also provides a "Data Disgestor Microservice" to process the data and make it available for further analysis or storage.
